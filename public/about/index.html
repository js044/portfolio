    <div id="bio-text"><p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Jay. I love art, reading, video games, and cats&ndash;there&rsquo;s one sitting in my lap as I type this! I also like crafts, stationery, and fountain pens. I have a broad and ever-expanding repertoire of interests. My latest venture is object-oriented programming, but my background is in design work. I hope you enjoy visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore, and don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out at <a href="mailto:jserrano.97@outlook.com">jserrano.97@outlook.com</a>.</p>
<p>For a little more background, I&rsquo;ve always been drawn to art, especially cartoons with vibrant colors and bold, eye-catching designs. As a child, I noticed how much design and aesthetics influenced our daily decisions: which products we selected at the grocery store, which books we plucked from the shelf, and the color of the crossing guard&rsquo;s uniform. Design was more than mere decoration; design was communication and a way of thinking.</p>
<p>This remained compelling to me even after I went to university. I majored in graphic design and learned more about the science of art, from color theory to anatomy to Gestalt principles. During my undergraduate years, I launched an interdisciplinary creative publication called <a href="https://cicadacreativemag.com/">Cicada Creative Magazine</a>, which allowed me to flex my design skills and pick up significant project management experience.</p>
<p>I had previously started to learn HTML and CSS through ventures on MySpace, Neopets, and Tumblr, and when CCM needed a website to host our periodical, I thought it would be simple enough to put these skills into practice. This assumption proved to be incorrect, but it was a surprisingly gratifying learning experience, and I became passionate about front-end web development.</p>
<p>After I graduated, I began working in freelance web design and development. I wanted to blend everything I had learned to help people launch their projects, and also stay up-to-date on best practices and design trends. These experiences have been valuable to me, and I&rsquo;m always grateful for more opportunities to learn.</p>
