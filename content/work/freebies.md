## Overview
I've created a few platform-agonstic template HTML/CSS/JS layouts with the intention of encouraging more people to build personal websites. These layouts use CSS variables to enable user customization and include ample in-code instruction to help beginners. All these freebie codes are hosted in a dedicated [Github repository](https://github.com/js044/freebies) and posted on social media to get the word out.

I try to keep the tech as simple as possible to be beginner-friendly. A lot of users have never heard of SASS, much less have access to a SASS compiler. I combine the HTML, CSS, and JS into one file and include detailed instructions on how to separate these into different files to use across multiple pages, or they can opt to just change the CSS variable parameters if they don't want to delve further into the code.
