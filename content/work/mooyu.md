## Overview
Moo-yu is a product design and branding project for a probiotic milk beverage similar to [yakult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakult). Its target audience is bilingual Koreans in English speaking countries who miss the drink and recognize the brand title as a bilingual pun, but it is also intended to function as a cultural bridge for English speakers who are unfamiliar with it.

## Style Guide
Moo-yu's visual identity is meant to be playful and colorful, blending youthful design sensibilities with a clean, sleek design language. I used rounded fonts for both the English and Korean typography to keep the branding young, but used minimal iconography to ensure it wasn't too childish for adults to drink. I arrived at my final logos after several iterations and attempted aesthetics.

I used conventional Adobe tools to implement this project. I used Photoshop to make mockups of the physical products, Illustrator to iterate different logotypes, and InDesign to create my style guides and presentations.

## Notable Features
### Bilingual Branding
The most notable element of the logo is the pun that uses Korean and English to create a pun. 우유 means milk in Korean, and is combined with "moo," the English onomatopoeia for the sound cows make. Further, 우유 is pronouned "uyu," and so when said literally, it sounds like "moo-yu," hence the title of the mock-up. I wanted to create a product that targets a very specific demographic (Koreans living in English-speaking countries), but is still comprehensible enough for people outside this demographic to approach. 

### Large Bottles
I specifically chose larger bottles for mock-ups rather than the traditionally small yakult bottles to appeal to a wider demographic. I also created versions with cartons to appeal to a shape that more readily invokes "milk." These larger, color coded bottles are more accessible in the Western, English speaking world, and thus might be more immediately appealing to this audience, while also offering a novel experience for Koreans who recognize the beverage.
