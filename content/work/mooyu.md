## Overview
Moo-yu is a product design and branding project for a probiotic milk beverage similar to [yakult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakult). Its target audience is Korean-Americans who miss the drink and recognize the brand title as a bilingual pun. 우유 means milk, and is combined with "moo," the English onomatopoeia for the sound cows make.
