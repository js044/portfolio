## Overview
Moo-yu is a product design and branding project for a probiotic milk beverage similar to [yakult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakult). Its target audience is Korean-Americans who miss the drink and recognize the brand title as a bilingual pun. 우유 means milk, and is combined with "moo," the English onomatopoeia for the sound cows make.

## Style Guide
Moo-yu's visual identity is meant to be playful and colorful, blending youthful design sensibilities with a clean, sleek design language. I used rounded fonts for both the English and Korean typography to keep the branding young, but used minimal iconography to ensure it wasn't too childish for adults to drink. I arrived at my final logos after several iterations and attempted aesthetics.

I used conventional Adobe tools to implement this project. I used Photoshop to make mockups of the physical products, Illustrator to iterate different logotypes, and InDesign to create my style guides and presentations.
