## Overview
Nenrikido is a web project I made to host my digital illustrations and free-to-use code. It is also home to a digital library, a richly featured Hugo-powered blog, and an RSS-integrated microblog. The site is modelled after a desktop layout and features a start menu footer modal, draggable windows, a search bar, and multiple themes.
