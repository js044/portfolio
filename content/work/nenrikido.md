## Overview
Nenrikido is a web project I made to host my digital illustrations and free-to-use code. It is also home to a digital library, a richly featured Hugo-powered blog, and an RSS-integrated microblog. The site is modelled after a desktop layout and features a start menu footer modal, draggable windows, a search bar, and multiple themes.

Nenrikido uses a static site generation stack to meet host site requirements and keep the site lightweight. My generator is **Hugo**, which allows for swift build times. I created a styling library with **SASS**, using theme maps and mix-ins to produce a visually interesting website. I also used **JavaScript** for functionality like modals, a footer clock, and theme switching. Additionally, I used JS libraries like **Muuri** and **Lunr** for layout control, draggable windows, tag filtering, and index/searching. The site is hosted on **Github** and I use a GitHub Action to automatically deploy my site to **Neocities**,  leveraging content-aware diffing for precise updates, optimizing efficiency by solely modifying altered files on each push.
