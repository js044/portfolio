# ABOUT ME

{{< bio >}}

Hello! I'm Jay. I love art, writing, video games, and cats. I'm insatiably curious and driven to learn everything I can. My latest venture is attempting to self-teach object-oriented programming to see where it takes me. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out at jserrano.97@outlook.com.

For a little more background: I've always been drawn to art, especially cartoons with vibrant colors and bold, eye-catching designs. As a child, I noticed how much design influenced our daily decisions and perceptions of reality. Which products we selected at the grocery store, how we judged books by their covers, the color of the crossing guard's uniform. Design was more than mere decoration; design was communication.

This remained compelling to me even after I went to university. I majored in graphic design and learned more about the science of art, from color theory to anatomy to Gestalt principles. During my undergrad years, I launched an interdisciplinary creative publication called [Cicada Creative Magazine](https://cicadacreativemag.com/), which allowed me to flex my newfound design skills and develop my ability to manage a team.

I had previously started to learn HTML and CSS through ventures on MySpace, Neopets, and Tumblr, and when CCM needed a website to host our periodical, I thought it would be simple enough to put these skills into practice. This assumption proved to be incorrect, but it was a surprisingly gratifying learning experience, and I became passionate about front-end web development. 

After I graduated, I began working in freelance web design and development. I wanted to blend everything I had learned to help people launch their projects, and also stay up-to-date on best practices and design trends. These experiences have been valuable to me, and I'm always grateful for more opportunities to learn.
