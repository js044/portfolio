# ABOUT ME

{{< bio >}}

Welcome to my website! I'm Jay, a multidisciplinary graphic designer who likes decorating the internet. My expertise spans UI/UX and web design, front-end web development, and digital illustration. I also dabble in visual identity, branding, and product design.

I've long been interested in how design influences our decisions, from the products we select at stores to the books we pick from shelves. I pursued a BFA in Graphic Design and honed my understanding of design principles and technical tools. During my undergraduate program, I founded [Cicada Creative Magazine](https://cicadacreativemag.com/), an all-arts publication. This venture merged my design expertise with my managerial skills, and it also challenged me to code a website to host our periodical. As Editor-in-Chief, I continue to guide the organization and oversee the website.

During my final year of college, I worked in marketing at a consulting firm. This deepened my understanding of visual communication strategies and consumer behavior. Post-graduation, equipped with new insights, I began working in freelance web design and development. As a result, I've refined my craft while learning to engage with diverse projects and clients. I've also prioritized staying up to date on the latest design trends and best practices.

To unwind, I enjoy writing, reading, and playing video games. I also enjoy digital fabrication and learning more about programming. I'm always looking for new hobbies to explore, and I have a long list of skills I'd like to develop.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore, and please don't hesitate to reach out via email at jserrano.97@outlook.com. Let's make something extraordinary together.
