# ABOUT ME

{{< bio >}}

Hi. I'm Jay, a multidisciplinary graphic designer who likes decorating online spaces and playing with code. My primary interests include web development, UI/UX and web design, and digital illustration, but I also dabble in visual identity and product design.

Design influences our decisions, from the products we select at stores to the books we pick from shelves. We don't always understand why, or how, but it does. I've always liked knowing the "why" and the "how," so I pursued a BFA in Graphic Design. During my undergraduate program, I learned design theory and how to practically apply it. I ended up founding  [Cicada Creative Magazine](https://cicadacreativemag.com/), an all-arts publication. My understanding of graphic design helped me launch the project, and in trying to get it off the ground, I discovered another passion. 

We needed a website to host our periodical. I co-designed the website, but the team realized we did not know how to actually implement it. As I had recently become interested in front-end web development, I decided to take on the task. It turned out to be more challenging and rewarding than I had expected. This venture with CCM merged my design expertise with my managerial skills and pushed me to grow. As Editor-in-Chief, I continue to guide the organization and oversee the website.

After I graduated, I began working in freelance web design and development. This taught me to engage with a wide array of projects and clients, manage multiple priorities, and work independently. I've also realized that learning is a lifelong process, staying up to date on the latest design trends and best coding practices. 

To unwind, I enjoy writing, reading, and playing video games. I love cats and taking walks. I'm endlessly curious and I always have more to learn--I'm currently learning more about object oriented programming to see where that takes me. Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
