# ABOUT ME

{{< bio >}}

Welcome to my website! I'm Jay, a multidisciplinary digital designer passionate about creating memorable online experiences. My expertise spans UI/UX and web design, front-end web development, and digital illustration. I also dabble in visual identity, branding, and product design.

I've long been captivated by the influence of design on our choices, from the products we select at stores to the books we pick from shelves. To develop my skills in alignment with this interest, I pursued a BFA in Graphic Design. During my undergraduate program, I founded [Cicada Creative Magazine](https://cicadacreativemag.com/), an all-arts publication. This venture not only merged my design expertise with my managerial skills--it also involved coding a website to host our periodical. As Editor-in-Chief, I continue to guide the organization and oversee the website.

During my final year of college, I worked in marketing at a consulting firm. This stint deepened my understanding of visual communication strategies and consumer behavior. Post-graduation, equipped with new insights, I embarked on a journey of freelance web design and development. As a result, I've honed my craft while learning to engage with diverse projects and clients. I've also prioritized staying up to date on the latest design trends and best practices.

To unwind, I enjoy creative writing, reading, cooking, and playing video games. My sixteen year old cat often accompanies me. I'm always looking for new hobbies to explore, and I have a long list of skills I'd like to develop.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore, and please don't hesitate to reach out via email at jserrano.97@outlook.com. Let's make something extraordinary together.
