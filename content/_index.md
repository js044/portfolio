## My name is *Jayleen Serrano*. 

But most people call me Jay. I'm a graphic designer and web developer currently located in Puerto Rico. I graduated from [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/) with a BFA in Graphic Design. I'm also the founder and Editor-in-chief of [Cicada Creative Magazine](https://cicadacreativemag.com/).
