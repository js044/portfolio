# WELCOME

## My name is *Jayleen Serrano*. 

Welcome to my portfolio website! I currently do marketing and design work for Athens-Clarke County Library, but I'm also passionate about responsive web design and coding static websites. I'm also the founder and Editor-in-chief of [Cicada Creative Magazine](https://cicadacreativemag.com/), an online all-arts publication. If you'd like to get in touch about a project or collaboration, feel free to use my [contact form](/contact)!
