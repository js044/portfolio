# WELCOME

## My name is *Jayleen Serrano*. 

But most people call me Jay. Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm a graphic designer and web developer currently located in Puerto Rico. I specialize in responsive web design and coding static websites, but I also do a lot of branding and visual identity work. I graduated from [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/) with a BFA in Graphic Design. I'm also the founder and Editor-in-chief of [Cicada Creative Magazine](https://cicadacreativemag.com/). If you're interested in working with me, you can [email me](/mailto:jserrano.97@outlook.com) or use my [contact form](/contact) to reach out and get a quote.
